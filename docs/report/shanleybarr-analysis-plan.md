# Planned revisions to reproduction of  "Reproduction of Chakraborty 2021: An intracategorical analysis of COVID-19 and people with disabilities"
Author: Grayson Shanley Barr
 
## Analysis: 
In this reproduction analysis I plan to: 
First, fixt the formatting of data table 1 which contains information on missing county data
Second, revise the visualization of county weights in the GEE model, the final map in the manuscript
Third, improve the map visualizations comparing SpatialEpi Clusters, SatScan GINI Optimized Coefficients, and SatScan Hierarchical Clusters for viewers to better understand where there is agreement or disagreement in the clusters with the various models by improving the color palettes. 
Fourth, I would like to improve the cohesion of the map visualizations, for example displaying county lines and state lines with consistent line weights and colors throughout the manuscript. 
Fifth, improve the visualziation of data tables and potentially rename columns so that they reflect clearer names rather than names from the original data frames. 
Sixth, I would like to edit and contribute my findings and critiques of the study to the discussion. For example the lack of inclusion of Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska in the cluster analysis. 
Finally, I would also like to add a short conclusion to the study.


 
## Results: 
	The majority of the changes I plan to make to the study are with the visualization of maps throughout the analysis as well as through the re-formatting of the data tables. I also plan to edit, synthesize, and contribute my perspective to the discussion. In addition I will add a short conclusion to discuss the efficacy of reproduction and what the implications of our findings are for the original study. 
 
## Discussion: 
My hope is that the revised maps and tables will provide visual clarity to accompany the analysis, the discussion will synthesize and consolidate findings for readers, and the conclusion will highlight the implications of findings in the reproduction analysis for the original study.
